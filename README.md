## Intallation

##### 1. Download

Using git:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/edfus/download-twitter-likes
cd  download-twitter-likes
```

...Or download manually via <https://github.com/edfus/download-twitter-likes/archive/master.zip>

##### 2. Install

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) & npm installed on your machine before proceeding.

```bash
# in download-twitter-likes folder
npm install --only=production
```

Node.js versions equal to or higher than 14.6.0 are supported. (ES6 import, WeakRef)

##### 3. Put favs.ndjson in the directory

You can get the `favs.ndjson` file using my [get-twitter-likes](https://github.com/edfus/get-twitter-likes) script, or reaching to other Twitter api scraper like [this python package](https://github.com/tekumara/twitter-likes) if you would prefer.

## Usage

```bash
npm run download

`
  command line arguments:
  --proxy=http://YOURPROXY:PORT
  --path="./PREFERED_WORKING_DIRECTORY" - default to "./" (pwd)
      set the default path for CRUD following files:
      - likes/                          - default output folder
        set "--output-folder=PATH/YOU/PREFER" to specify the exact path for storing media other than ${path}/likes/
      - favs.ndjson                     - default source
        set "--ndjson-path=PATH/NDJSON.ndjson" to retrieve sources from a preferred ndjson file
      - media.log.txt                   - log file
      - media.db.csv                    - database

  --log-filtered
    set --log-filtered flag will log all entries filtered either by url_filter or pathname_filter out.
  --log-succeeded
    turn log-succeeded on will lead to succeeded downloads being logged too.
`

```

Remember to skim through the log file first if any problem was encountered.

## Personalize

**Default behaviors**:

- Making 10 requests per seconds.

<br>

- Add all successfully downloaded media's url to database.
- If a media's url already exists in database, that media got filtered.
- If a dirent with the same name exist in output folder, discard according download.

<br>

- If a Tweet has multiple media, group them in a folder.
- Delete the empty folders when download failed for multi-media Tweets.

<br>

- For animated_gif/video, download the variant with maximum bitrate.
- For photos, fetch them over HTTP to be faster.

<br>

- `customInitializer`: await database loaded.
- Log failing downloads's details, being slient on filtered/succeeded.

<br>

- Filename:

In `index.mjs`, navigate to the `main` section, locate the `download favs` annotation that serves as a thematic break, and scroll down a little bit, the naming logic is here:

```js
const details = replaceReservedChars(
  [
    customizeDateFormat(new Date(fav.created_at)),
    fav.user.name.concat("@").concat(fav.user.screen_name),
    fav.id_str 
  ]
    .join("_")
    .concat(fav.retweeted ? "--retweeted" : "")
);
```

That will produce names like `2020-12-22_æš¦@koyomiyoko_o_1341064343962587136`.

Notably, the `2020-12-22` was a product of function `customizeDateFormat` in `config`section above, converting en-us time format `12/22/2020` to `2020-12-22`. It may not work properly on your machine under a different time format.

Take a look at [Twitter's official guidance](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/data-dictionary/object-model/extended-entities) or [favs-example.ndjson](https://github.com/edfus/download-twitter-likes/blob/master/favs-example.ndjson) for reference about things you can access for DIY file naming.
